<h3 id="one"> Spotlight on CyberSecurity </h3>

<p>This semester, I am taking CIT425/L alongside the rest of my courses. CIT425 is a Information and Systems Security class taught by Dr. Kaplan. In the class we explore a broad selection of systems security issues, concepts, and policies with topics within the principles of information systems security that include cryptography, identifications and authentications, access control models and mechanisms, multilevel database security, Internet security, risk analysis, and social issues that include the role privacy plays in our everyday lives in a society that has become heavily reliant on technology. In this week's blog, I will discuss the importance of cybersecurity in the modern world.

  Security Overlooked
  </h4>  
<p>More often than not, organizations and companies may turn their cheek against doing proper upgrades and updates that can significantly impact day to day operations, thus making them vulnerable to possible cyber attacks. Why is this so? In a society where the next big thing can happen in a matter of seconds, keeping up to date with the latest trends and nuances can prove to be quite a costly thing to do. Similar to upgrading to the latest smartphone or the latest operating system, it is easy to become outdated. When this happens, it is easier for companies to decide that they might not need the latest upgrades to their hardware or personnel. However, in today's society, there is nothing you cannot find in the Internet that can leave your internal infrastructure vulnerable. 
</p>
  
<p>Cyber Security is also easily overlooked as a true "threat" in many instances as many people deem it non-lethal in many cases. Up until recently, there have been no true cases in which a cyber attack has proved to be lethal. That is until very recently.

<p>In recent events, on September 17, 2020, the first death directly associated with a cyberattack occurred after it was reported that a women in Germany passed away after being redirected to a hospital 20 miles away due to an attack that hit Duesseldorf University Hospital. The hopital became victim to ransomware, crashing many of their servers, prompting immediate shut down causing them to turn away any new patients coming in under emergency circumstances. 
</p>
  
<p>It was reported that the attack was meant for a nearby university and not for the hopital itself. Unfortunately, one of the many negative results of this attack was the loss of hundreds of medical records. The attackers were notified of this and how the the attack was putting many patients at risk due to the many machines and softwares reliant on connection to the internet. This was also the first instance in which, once notified of the misdirection, the attackers willingly stopped the attack and provided the encryption key to unlock the compromised data. 
</p>  
  
<p>Although the information was eventually turned over, the situation still faced dire consequences making experts claim that this attack would hopefully be a wake up call for many organizations and administrators that more action needs to be done in order to prevent attacks such as this.
